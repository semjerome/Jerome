**Executive Summary**

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and /or actuators for detecting car collision and save the
captured image/video in a black box The database will store the timestamp and
the folder location of the video that were saved in the blackbox. The mobile
device functionality will include notifying the car owner of an accident
happening and if possible, an image or video capture of the accident and will be
further detailed in the mobile application proposal. We will be collaborating
with the following company/department Engineering Club. The hardware will be
completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques independently and the
application will be completed in CENG 319 Software Project. These will be
integrated together in the subsequent term in CENG 355 Computer Systems Project
as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

**Background**

The problem solved by project is to not to prevent any accident but to get
evidence if an accident happened. Having a dash cam does not mean that if an
accident happened there would be footage of what happened. Sometimes, accident
happens on the side or back of the car. In the event that such thing happened,
the people will rely on the story of a witness or the victims. Sometimes the
people will try to change their story in order for them to get away with it. If
such thing happens, the police will have to look around and see if a CCTV has
captured the accident.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read which provides insight into similar
efforts.

The first journal that we found presents “ the approach to use smartphones as a
multi sensor platform in a field operational test respectively a naturalistic
driving study”. [@6758745]

The second journal talks about optical camera used for vehicles. [@7801077]

For the last journal, it then talks about inevitable accidents that can happen
with motorcycles and automobiles. [@7410053]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project. \pagebreak

**Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project: Phase 1 Hardware build. Phase 2
System integration. Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

Phase 1 Hardware build

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

Phase 2 System integration

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

**Concluding remarks**

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for mini computer
and black box for car. This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and
skills developed in our program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project
demonstrating my ability to learn how to support projects such as the initiative
described by our professor. I request approval of this project.

Abstract (Executive Summary)
============================

In today’s society, car has been part of our daily life. Based on National
Safety Council, around 27,000 accidents occur everyday in United States alone
but only 0.3 percent of it result in a fatality. The problem solved by our
project is not to prevent any accident, but to get evidence if an accident
happened. Having a dash cam does not mean that if an accident happened there
would be footage of what happened. Sometimes, accident happens on the side or
back of the car. In the event that such thing happened, the people will rely on
the story of a witness or the victims. Sometimes the people will try to change
their story in order for them to get away with it. If such thing happens, the
police will have to look around and see if a CCTV has captured the accident.
With our project, it will help the police or the Insurance Company to determine
who is at fault if an accident occurs without any hassle. And at the same time,
it will encourage the driver to abide the road rules since this project can be
used against them if they do not.

1. Introduction
===============

1.1 Purpose
-----------

The purpose of this documentation is to give a detailed description of the
requirements for the "Telematics" hardware and all of the software that comes
with it. It will explain system constraints, system interface and interactions
with other external applications. This documentation is primarily intended for
our professor and his approval as well as reference for developing the system.

1.2 Scope
---------

The "Telematics" is a hardware that helps the police, insurance companies and
drivers to determine the cause of a car incident. The hardware will have 3
cameras (one on each side and one on the rear). Although in this prototype, it
will only have one camera because the raspberry pi3 can only support 1 raspberry
pi camera at at ime. It will also have an Android application where the user can
review any previous incident that has happened and add more information if
needed.

Upon installing the hardware, the user has to register through the official
website and enter the appropriate information and product key. From then on, the
hardware will be able to send any information to the database once it is
connected to the internet. The hardware does not need to maintain a network
connection in order to work. Once the car starts, it will start recording and
will replace the old file with a new file until it detects an accident. Once the
hardware detects an incident, it will lock the file and will not be able to be
overwritten until it is successfully uploaded to the server. Once the hardware
is connected to the network, it will upload the video to the server and any
information related to incident such as date and the location of the incident.

Furthermore, the user will be able to access the information to through their
Android phone. From the moblie application, they will need to log in in order to
retrieve the information related to their account. The user can then review the
incident and add information about the incident such as, the car and driver's
information. If the user does not have an android phone, they can do everything
that was mentioned above through the official website.

2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
============================================

2.1 Technology Introduction
---------------------------

#### 2.1.1 Purpose

The purpose of our software is to provide an automated service for drivers that
notifies them of any accidents or damages that may have occurred to their car.
With the use of mobile application, the owner will have the data of the location
and video feed of the accident. It will also serve as a data storage regarding
the accident for the owner. They will be able to input additional information
about the driver, the car, as well as information needed for the insurance
company. A website will be available for the user to register an account for
them to use the mobile application.

#### 2.1.2 Product Overview

The product will have piezo vibration sensors that will detect if there are any
collisions detected. Raspberry Pi camera module will also be used to record
video.

#### 2.1.3 Targeted Audience Group:

Our target audience is any person that has a car and insurance company for they
will be able to use the video feed as a proof of an incident.

2.2 Product Information
-----------------------

#### 2.2.1 Main Functionality

The main functionality of our system is to provide an incident report on user's
mobile device in case of an accident. Information that the user saves on the
application can then be used by them for their insurance company. The hardware
will provide the video feed as well as the coordinates of the report.

#### 2.2.2 Extra Requirements

Internet connection is needed for the hardware device for it to be able to send
the report, video and location, to the database. Implementation of battery
powered raspberry pi will also be needed for it to be placed inside the car.

-----------------------

#### 2.3.1 System Interface

System interface for our project includes: collision detector hardware, database
server, and mobile application. If an accident is detected from the hardware, it
sends an accident report to the server. The user through the use of mobile
application in which he/she can retrieve the video file and location of the
accident can then access this report. The user will also be able to delete the
report (in case of false report), as well as add information to the report.

#### 2.3.2 Database

We are going to use the GoDaddy's database to store the information about the
user, the accident, the driver they had an accident with and the car that the
other driver was using. For the user infomration, we are going to store the
username password and its user's id. For the password, we are going to encrypt
the user's password using MD5 to protect the password just in case someone tries
to hack our system. In accident table, we are going to the store the reporrtId,
incident date, video name, longitude and latitude. In the driver table, we are
going to store the other driver's license, first name,, last name, gender and
insurance number. In the car table, we are going to store the other driver's car
information such as plate number, brand, model and the year it was manufactured.
(Jerome)

A separate database will be created for car makes and models, which is then
going to be used for the mobile application. It will be used for drop-down
spinners of both car makes and models. (Jabneel)

#### 2.3.3 Hardware

Our hardware is a collision detector. Once the car has start up, the hardware
will start running immediately. It will start recording as soon as it is start
up. It will have loop and lock functionality. With the loop functionality, the
hardware will replace the old video with a new video, which prevents the
hardware from using too much memory. The lock functionality will lock up the
video file if the hardware detects any collision. It will lock up the file until
the hard is connected to the Internet.(Jerome)

Once it is connected, it will upload the file to the server and store the date
that the video was captured, the location and the name of the video. It will
also have a GUI(Graphic USer Interface so that it will be easy to use for new
user.(Jaewoong)

#### 2.3.4 Mobile Application

Our mobile application is called AutAcc Report and is exclusive to Android. With
the mobile app, the user is able to retrieve any incident related to the user.
Once it is able to retrieve an incident report, the user will be able to add
more information about the driver that he/she had an accident with and the car
he/she was using. The application has playback functionality where it can watch
the video that was captured during the incident. It also has map functionality
where it will pinpoint the exact location of the incident by using Google map.
(Jabneel)

The mobile app also has functionality where the user can contact his/her
insurance agent where he/she can report the incident. User accounts and having
access to different reports is also a requirement. (Jerome)

#### 2.3.5 Web Application

For our project, we will also provide a website. The front-end design and user
interface of the website will be worked on by Jabneel and Achille. Usability and
design of the website will require. Developed by (Jabneel) and user testing done
by (Achille).

In the website, the user will be able to register. If the user is already
registered, he/she will be able to review the information related to his/her
account. He/she will also be able to delete an incident or modify any
information related to that incident. The user can also change their password.
This will be worked on by (Jerome).

2.4 Future Consideration
------------------------

#### 2.4.1 Operating Environment

To fully utilize this product you will need an Android device (Tablet or phone)
on the OS android 4.4 KitKat and above (API 19 and above). This product does not
require constant internet connection. An Internet connection is only required
when you need to synchronize the hardware with the database.

#### 2.4.2 Safety Consideration

Safety precaution that has to be considered when using the hardware:

-   When using the hardware, make sure that the hardware is properly plugged in
    before turning on the car.

-   Avoid sunlight exposure

#### 2.4.3 Future Additions

We are planning on creating a new case for the hardware since we are planning on
adding a touchscreen capability on our hardware.

2.5 Build Instructions
----------------------

#### 2.5.1 Introduction

The project will be able to detect car collision and save the recorded video
into a file server to be used by the android application. The goal of this
project is to notify the car owner of an accident happening. The owner should be
able to access the video of the recorded accident using their mobile
application. We are using a vibration sensor (buzzer) to detect an impact signal
that will be sent to the raspberry pi which then would run the camera to record
a 20 second video that will be sent to the server. This video file can then be
accessesed by the owner by using an android application. Take note that for now,
our current production build is only sending the video file to the owner's email
address.

3.Conclusion
============

In this report, we wrote the purpose of this telematics and how to reproduce it.
By following the instructions, you should be able to reproduce it and should run
on how it is supposed to. On the other hand, it is not possible to create a
working PCB as there are some connection issues.

\pagebreak

4.Recommendation
================

When reproducing this hardware, it is recommended to get a Raspberry Pi 3 or
later version. It is not recommended to use an earlier version because it does
not have any built-in wi-fi or bluetooth capability.

To increase the reliability of the hardware, it is advicable to use Gravity
sensor instead of vibration sensor. By using Gravity sensor, the video will only
be lock when there is a disruption on the movememnt of the car. On the other
hand, vibration sensor will lock the video everytime it sense a vibration.

Improvements that can be made on Android Mobile Application are the following:
Have each fragments for video, location, driver and car in separate page
fragments.
